# Cucumber Notes
BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

feature file: test scenario which is in plain english.

Product owner might make the feature file and give it to QA and QA will check it and return to Product owner. When Product Owner is happy with the feature file, Automation Testers will make tests with the feature file.

There is a gap between what qa understands and what product owner understands. With BDD, we have a common feature file which both understands. Product Owner will know what are the things QA is testing. If PO wants, he can execute the tests and see. Brought transparency between PO, QA, even Devs.

Cucumber supports many languages, so it has Internationalization.
